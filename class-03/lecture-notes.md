# Lecture Notes: Class 03

- Feedback Overview
  - "One of the least helpful aspects of this course would be the readings...just the way I learn faster and more efficient is from watching a video of someone describing code it gives a whole different perspective on it than reading."
  - "This week was a little difficult for me just because of the hectic nature of my life"
  - "While I appreciate covering the bias topic in class, I feel that too much of an emphasis has a negative effect on everyone learning. Yes drawing attention to these types of issues are necessary however I think paying too much attention detracts from the purpose of acknowledging bias."
  - "I do get a little lost when trying to take notes or run through some code."
  - "I will probably not give a 10/10 from now on because I think there is always things to improve"
  - "I hope more people open up this class as it's a bit quieter than last one."
  - "Also that console, iTerm2? I'm gonna have to look into that, looked pretty damn nice."

- `array.filter()` Shred Talk
  - [Demo on Repl.it](https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n25-Code-Challenge-filter#index.js)
  - Similar to `array.forEach()` and `array.map()`, the `array.filter` method iterates over an array and runs a callback for each element.
  - The callback receives the currentValue and the index of the array element as a parameter.
  - .filter() will always return you a new array, comprised of elements from the original array that match your criteria
    - Think about it this way: which elements in the array match the filter condition?
