- `array.filter()` Shred Talk
  - Similar to `array.forEach()` and `array.map()`, the `array.filter` method iterates over an array and runs a callback for each element.
  - The callback receives the currentValue and the index of the array element as a parameter.
  - .filter() will always return you a new array, comprised of elements from the original array that match your criteria
    - Think about it this way: which elements in the array match the filter condition?
