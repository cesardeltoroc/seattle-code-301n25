# Lecture Notes: Class 02

- Changes made in Canvas today
  - Labs will now be published an hour before the start of the class in which we are lecturing/demoing that lab.
    - EXAMPLE: lab 03 will be available on Saturday at 8am(PST).
    - EXAMPLE: lab 04 will be available on Tuesday at 5:30pm(PST).
  - Reading assignment due times have been updated to reflect their actual due time.
    - EXAMPLE: reading 03 is due on Saturday, at the start of class time: 9:00am(PST).
    - EXAMPLE: reading 04 is due on Tuesday, at the start of class time: 6:30pm(PST).
  - Retros are due the same day they are assigned, no later than 11:59pm(PST).

- Code Challenge Shred Talk: `array.map()`
  - `array.map()` demo in Repl.it
    - <https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n25-Code-Challenge-map#index.js>
  - The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
  - Similar to `array.forEach()`, the `array.map()` method iterates over an array and runs a callback for each element.
  - The difference is that `.map()` will always return you a new array of the same length as the original array, comprised of the return values from each function call.
    - The original array is never mutated.
    - You always get back a new array.
    - Remember, `.forEach` does NOT give us back an array. It returns `undefined` and that is why we have to push the results of each function call into a new, local array.

- React
  - Props is an object, special to React, that allows us to pass data down from parent components via a custom attribute on the child component.
  - The child component can access that data using `this.props.attributeName` syntax.
  - Let's talk about how to render an image in React.
    - Photos can be imported into React components, from your `src` folder, just like any other resource.
    - You can also use an image's source URL and assign it to the `src` attribute on your img element.
    - Both ways are valid, but most jobs will have a style guide to follow that will determine which method they prefer.
  - State is used as a way of configuring components with properties.
    - State can keep track of things as other components(or the same component) are changing.
    - State is a special property we inherit from React.Component.
    - State is an object, that is a property of the class component it is initalized inside of.
    - State acts like a global variable, holding a "snapshot" of the data in it's current condition.

- Bootstrap
  - We want our application to look nice but we don't always know how to accomplish that.
  - A styling library that allows us to tap into built, styled components.
  - components just like any other component we would make, but with styling already added
  - steps:
    - go to the Bootstrap React web docs
    - click "Getting Started"
    - grab installation script from the beginning of the page
      - run that in the root of your project
    - see further down on the page where it tells you to `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` and add that line to your index.js
    - then explore the component library to see which components you want to use and figure out how to use them
    - check out the component's API for additional attributes

- Deployment on Netlify
  - We want to share our application with the world.
  - Netlify is a platform that allows us to deploy our React application.
  - steps:
    - Navigate to <https://www.netlify.com/>
    - Click “Sign Up” in the top right corner
    - Choose GitHub to sign up with
    - Click on “Add new site”
    - Choose “Import an existing project”
    - Click on the GitHub button
    - You can either “Search repos” OR “Configure Netlify on GitHub”
    - Enter your GitHub password
    - Scroll down to Repository access and choose “All repositories”
    - Click “Save”
    - Search for your Gallery of Horns repo and click on it
    - Scroll down and look under the Basic build settings, in the Publish directory input field, add a “/” after the word “build”
    - Click “Deploy site”
    - Click on the Deploys tab
    - Look to the right for the “Trigger deploy” button, click on it and select “Deploy site”
    - Watch the deploy logs and wait for the success message: “Build script success”
    - You can either click the “Preview” button at the top OR navigate back to the Site overview tab and click on your green deployed URL link at the top.
